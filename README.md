This is a Tauri app that will function as an ebook reader. Currently it is still a WIP.

So far the app is able to fetch all epub files that are stored in the HOME/Books directory, and display them in a library-like ui.
This obviously needs a lot of additional work, but i'm planning to get there soon ðŸ«¡  

The current library expects the epub to be in a format that is disributed on Project Gutenberg, other epubs that don't have the file structured similarly might run into problems. Again, this shouldn't really be permanent, it is just a result of only testing it from material off Project Gutenberg!
